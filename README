INTEGER or DOUBLE. UNSIGNED SHORT is the default. Changes to this storage type is done in the 
Makefile.

On systems with 'make' - make sure you are in the SICTIN directory and type 'make'. 

* To manually compile:

g++ -O3 -DSHR_REP -c src/utils.cpp -o bin/utils.o

g++ -O3 -DSHR_REP src/make_footprint.cpp bin/utils.o -o bin/make_footprint
